----------------How to run -------------------
1. Extract the flickrAPI folder into xampp htdocs folder.
2. Run xampp control panel
3. Open browser of choice and navigate to the following url:
	'http://localhost/flickrAPI/index.html'
4. Enter a search term for images and click the search button.
5. Click an image and it will display the image on a new page.

NB. I originally started out by using php to retrieve the images from 
the api, however I decided it would be better to show more JavaScript
ability if i was to use JavaScript/JQuery. Anyway, this change made it 
take longer than I intended.
I used 4 hours. My fault but I did what I could in the time.

Thanks,

Adam.
